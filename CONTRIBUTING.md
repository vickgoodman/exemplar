## Development

### Configure and Build the Project Using CMake Presets

This project recommends using [CMake Presets](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/cmake-presets.7.html)
to configure, build and test the project.
Appropriate presets for major compilers have been included by default.
You can use `cmake --list-presets` to see all available presets.

Here is an example to invoke the `gcc-debug` preset.

```shell
cmake --workflow --preset gcc-debug
```

Generally, there are two kinds of presets, `debug` and `release`.

The `debug` presets are designed to aid development, so it has debugging
instrumentation enabled and many sanitizers enabled.

> [!NOTE]
>
> The sanitizers that are enabled vary from compiler to compiler.
> See the toolchain files under ([`cmake`](cmake/)) to determine the exact configuration used for each preset.

The `release` presets are designed for production use, and
consequently have the highest optimization turned on (e.g. `O3`).

### Configure and Build Manually

If the presets are not suitable for your use-case, a traditional CMake
invocation will provide more configurability.

To configure, build and test the project with extra arguments,
you can run this set of commands.

```bash
cmake \
  -B build \
  -S . \
  -DCMAKE_CXX_STANDARD=17 \
  # Your extra arguments here.
cmake --build build
ctest --test-dir build
```

> [!IMPORTANT]

> Beman projects are
> [passive projects](https://github.com/bemanproject/beman/blob/main/docs/beman_standard.md#cmake),
> therefore,
> you will need to specify the C++ version via `CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD`
> when manually configuring the project.

### Finding and Fetching GTest from GitHub

If you do not have GoogleTest installed on your development system, you may
optionally configure this project to download a known-compatible release of
GoogleTest from source and build it as well.

Example commands:

```shell
cmake -B build -S . \
    -DCMAKE_PROJECT_TOP_LEVEL_INCLUDES=./infra/cmake/use-fetch-content.cmake \
    -DCMAKE_CXX_STANDARD=17
cmake --build build --target all
cmake --build build --target test
```

The precise version of GoogleTest that will be used is maintained in
`./lockfile.json`.

### Project specific configure arguments

Project-specific options are prefixed with `BEMAN_EXEMPLAR`.
You can see the list of available options with:

```bash
cmake -LH -S . -B build | grep "BEMAN_EXEMPLAR" -C 2
```

<details>

<summary> Details of CMake arguments. </summary>

#### `BEMAN_EXEMPLAR_BUILD_TESTS`

Enable building tests and test infrastructure. Default: ON.
Values: `{ ON, OFF }`.

You can configure the project to have this option turned off via:

```bash
cmake -B build -S . -DCMAKE_CXX_STANDARD=17 -DBEMAN_EXEMPLAR_BUILD_TESTS=OFF
```

> [!TIP]
> Because this project requires GoogleTest for running tests,
> disabling `BEMAN_EXEMPLAR_BUILD_TESTS` avoids the project from
> cloning GoogleTest from GitHub.

#### `BEMAN_EXEMPLAR_BUILD_EXAMPLES`

Enable building examples. Default: ON. Values: { ON, OFF }.

#### `BEMAN_EXEMPLAR_INSTALL_CONFIG_FILE_PACKAGE`

Enable installing the CMake config file package. Default: ON.
Values: { ON, OFF }.

This is required so that users of `beman.exemplar` can use
`find_package(beman.exemplar)` to locate the library.
